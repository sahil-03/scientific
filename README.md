An app where you can upload research papers (PDFs) and talk to them as you read. Uses some really simple RAG and chat in the backend. 

Prerequisite:

  To do so, open your terminal and enter the following commands:
  1. Go to OpenAI, login/create an account, and generat an API key. 
  2. `echo "export OPENAI_API_KEY='your api key here'" >> ~/.zshrc` (or ` ... >> ~/.bashrc`)
  3. `source ~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`)
